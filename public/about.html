<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Seventeen  is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has conquered a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances.</p>

<p>The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat,[2] which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US[3] and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list.[4][5] Seventeen has released four studio albums, twelve EPs and three reissues.</p>

<p>Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances.[6][7] They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.[8][9][10][11]</p>
